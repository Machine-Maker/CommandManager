# CommandManager
This is a Java class that plugin developers can add to their plugins that makes creating new commands super simple.  

This is acomplished by utilizing the annotaions feature in Java. (NOTE: This util only works with Java 8 because of [Repeatable Annotations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/repeating.html).

Currently the framework is relatively light, but the functionality of these annotations is powerful.

### Taste of the features
+ Argument typing
+ Command user type (console or player or both)
+ Single/Multipler permissions
+ No more forgetting about putting the commands in your plugin.yml! \o/
